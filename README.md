- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kenta20
- 👀 I’m interested in Factorio, Minecraft, Rimworld... Basically, games that can be modded to within an inch of their lives. I wanna learn how to do that!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Lua, cuz that's what Factorio uses ((besides FAL) as far as I know)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on figuring out how any of this stuff works. I dunno what API even stands for yet.
- 📫 How to reach me ... (why would you want to ... yet) email, probably.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I live in Alaska!
